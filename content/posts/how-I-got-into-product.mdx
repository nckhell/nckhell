As a teenager, I was into everything that had something to do with computers. The ability to write a piece of code and see something appear on the screen was just something that blew my mind back then. **I was around 14 years old when I developed my first website.** It was that time when you designed a website in Photoshop, "sliced" it, and imported the assets into Dreamweaver. We still used table tags to build the layout of your web pages. No flexbox, no grid, just tables. I loved it though and quite fast I started landing some projects for actual “clients”, mostly due to mouth-to-mouth publicity from friends & family.

**During puberty, my love and passion for sports, fitness, and the human body was sparked.** Like every 16-year-old teenager you want to look good and gaining some muscle was definitely part of that. I started going to the gym regularly but soon realized that I also wanted to understand the science behind proper training and the anatomy of the human body.

When graduating from high school I had to decide what I wanted to do next. In my head, there was a concrete choice to make: becoming a software engineer or a physiotherapist.

I decided to chase my oldest passion first and started my **Bachelor's as a software engineer** in 2011. It was everything I expected and more. **I learned how to design, implement, test, and ship software** and had the opportunity to work on some cool projects, and had an amazing internship at a web development agency (shout out to [Multimedium](https://www.multimedium.be/)).

However, not long after graduating, I was thinking about that other passion of mine. It was always there in the back of my mind and never really went away. And although I was excited to start working as a software engineer, I also had the feeling I was potentially missing out on things. Over the summer I, therefore, made the decision to chase the dream of becoming a Physiotherapist. **That journey started in 2014 and five years later I officially graduated with an MSc in Rehabilitation Sciences & Physiotherapy.**

It still leaves the question unanswered, "How did I get into Product?". That's a story with some luck and coincidence. But on the other hand, I always say you can force your own luck **by taking opportunities that come your way and by working hard**. The story starts in 2017 during my 1st master's year. I needed to write a thesis under the supervision of a promotor.

My promoter had this project in mind around **Electronic Patient-Reported Outcome Measurements** (EPROMs) and wanted to build a custom electronic survey app to do research on the benefits of EPROMs vs. the traditional paper-pen-based manner of collecting data. They actively screened students to find a profile that would fit into the scope of this project and **guess who was a software engineer and eventually ended up working on that project**? Yes, me! I was genuinely super excited: a project where I could combine both of my passions. It was a match made in heaven.

**One of the first things we did was to go to a "Healthcare Hackathon".** For those of you that are not familiar, a hackathon is an event where you bring together bright minds to collaborate intensively to solve problems with software and/or hardware. One of the topics of that Hackathon was EPROMs so it was a great place for us to get started. **That is where I got in touch with Thomas & Yann from Awell Health** as they were part of our team during that Hackathon. We collaborated intensively during the Hackathon and eventually were able to create a fully working prototype of the project with Awell’s software.

Awell Health was just founded at that time and only Thomas & Yann were involved. However, at the end of the Hackathon, they asked me if I wanted to join the company as a working student and do some work for them on a regular basis. I said yes and effectively during the last 2 years of my master I was actually already working for Awell. When I graduated in the summer of 2019 they offered me a full-time position and I immediately said yes.

**At a start-up you wear multiple hats so I was doing a lot of stuff:** writing code, creating designs, customer success, managing integrations, and much more. My main responsibility in the first year was on the operational side. I was responsible for building clinical care pathways with and for clients. Nonetheless, because you are wearing multiple hats, I also had the chance to prove my skills with regard to building product. **That skillset was acknowledged and valued by the rest of the team** and that is why we decided in the spring of 2021 that I would “officially” take up the role as our Head of Product.

**And that's how I got into Product.**
