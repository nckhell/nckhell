title: How I got into Product Management
preview: The background story on how I got into product management. From software engineer to a physiotherapist, to product manager in a healthcare company.

As a young teenager, <strong>I was into everything that had something to do with computers</strong>: gaming, burning my own CDs and DVDs, Photoshop, and just building things in general. The ability to write a piece of code and see something appearing on my screen was just something that blew my mind back then. I was only around 14yo when I started developing my first website. It was that time when you had to design websites in Photoshop, "slice" them, import it into Dreamweaver, and use tables for the layout of your pages (no flexbox, no grid, just tables ðŸ¤¯). I loved it though and quite fast I started getting my first projects in for actual clients, mostly due to mouth-to-mouth promotion from friends & family.

During puberty, a second fire started to burn within me and that was my <strong>passion for sports, fitness, and the human body</strong>. Like every 16 yo teenager you want to look good and gaining some muscle was definitely part of that. So, I started going to the gym regularly but soon realized that I also wanted to understand the science behind proper training and the anatomy of the human body.

There I was, the 18yo version of me that just graduated from high school and I had to decide what I wanted to do next. <strong>In my head, there was a concrete choice to make</strong>: becoming a software engineer or a physiotherapist. <u>Or maybe both</u>?

I decided to chase my oldest passion first and started my <strong>Bachelor's as a software engineer</strong> in 2011. It was everything I expected and had the opportunity to work on some cool projects (<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms0Zoa0D4QQ&t=2s&ab_channel=NickHellemans'>I even sent a weather balloon to space ðŸš€</a>). <strong>I learned to design, build, and test software</strong> and gained some experience with internships at amazing companies. I was even offered a job at one of the places I did an internship so I was super happy, proud, and really got my future figured out - or that's at least what my friends & family thought.

However, quickly after graduating I was thinking again about that second passion of mine. It was always there in the background and never really went away. And although I was excited to start working as a software engineer, I also had the feeling I was potentially missing out on things. <strong>Over the summer I, therefore, made the decision to chase the dream to become a Physiotherapist</strong>. That journey started in 2014 and I graduated with an MSc in Rehabilitation Sciences & Physiotherapy in 2019.

It still leaves the question open: "<strong>How did I get into Product Management?</strong>". That's a story with some luck and coincidence but on the other hand, I always say you can <u>force your own luck by taking all the opportunities that come your way and just working hard for it</u>. The story starts in 2017 during my first master's year. To graduate with a master, you need to write a thesis and a thesis is always written under the supervision of a promotor. The promotor I ended up working with had this project in mind around Electronic Patient-Reported Outcome Measurements (EPROMs) and they wanted to build their own electronic survey tool to do research on the benefits of EPROMs vs. the traditional paper-pen based way of collecting data from patients. They actively screened students to find a profile that would fit into the scope of this project and guess who was a software engineer and eventually ended up working on that project? Yes, me! I was genuinely super excited: a project where I could combine both of my passions. It was a match made in heaven.

One of the first things we did was to go to a "<strong>Healthcare Hackathon</strong>". For those of you that are not familiar, a hackathon is an event where you bring together bright minds to collaborate intensively to solve problems with software and/or hardware. One of the topics of that Hackathon was EPROMs so it was a great place for us to get started. <strong>That's where I got in touch with Thomas & Yann from Awell Health</strong> as they were part of our team during that Hackathon. We collaborated intensively during the Hackathon and were able to create a fully working prototype of what we wanted to build.

Awell Health was just founded at that time and only Thomas & Yann were involved. However, at the end of the Hackathon, they asked me if I wanted to join the company as a working student and do some work for them on a regular basis. <strong>I said yes and during the last 2 years of my education, I was actually already working for Awell Health</strong>. When I finally graduated they offered me a "real" job and I joined the company in the summer of 2019. It's crazy to realize that I have the ability to do a job where I'm able to combine both of my passions: Technology & Healthcare. Lucky me.

<p><strong>At a start-up, people wear multiple hats so I was also doing a lot of stuff</strong>: building the product through design & coding, but also operational work. My main responsibility was on the operational side, as Head of Delivery I was responsible for building care pathways with and for clients and making sure they went live. Because you wear multiple hats at a start-up, I also had the chance to show my skills in regards to building a product. The company clearly saw my value there and in the summer of 2021 officially asked me whether I wanted to become Head of Product at Awell Health.</p>

<p><strong>And that's how I got into Product Management</strong>.</p>
